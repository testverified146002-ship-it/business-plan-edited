##  BUSINESS MODEL & REVENUE STREAMS

### Revenue Stream 1: Agent Subscription Fees
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Signup fee | $299 (one-time) |
| Monthly subscription | $45/month ($540/year) |
| **Annual fee revenue per agent** | **$839** |

### Revenue Stream 2: Agent Commission Split
Using RateHawk's net rate markup model:
- Agents receive wholesale net rates (typically 15-25% below retail)
- Agents set their own markup freely (recommended 15-25%)
- Trip Tailors takes 20% of the agent's markup/commission (standard tier)

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Avg booking commission | $300 | $600 | $900 |
| Bookings/agent/month | 3 | 5 | 7 |
| Annual bookings/agent | 36 | 60 | 84 |
| TT annual commission/agent (20%) | $2,160 | $7,200 | $15,120 |

### Revenue Stream 3: Lead Marketplace
Leads generated from the Referral Hub and Public Website are sold to agents:
| Lead Strength | Price | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| Standard | $5 | Basic inquiry, minimal detail, low budget |
| Qualified | $10 | Budget, destination, dates confirmed, modest budget |
| Premium | $20 | High budget, specific requirements, departure location |

Agents see key details (budget, destination, departure location, number of travelers) and choose which leads to purchase.

### Revenue Stream 4: Referral Program (NET COST)
This is a **cost center** that feeds the lead marketplace:
- $50 paid per booked referral to the referrer
- Monthly rewards add additional costs for high-performing referrers
- **Offset by:** Lead marketplace revenue + commission splits on referred bookings

### Combined Revenue Per Agent (Annual, Moderate Scenario)
| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Subscription fees | $839 |
| Commission split (20% of $500 × 60) | $6,000 |
| Lead purchases (avg 3/month × $10) | $360 |
| **Total average revenue per agent** | **$7,199** |

### Unit Economics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Agent Acquisition Cost | $150-$300 (marketing + onboarding) |
| Lifetime Value (LTV, 3-year avg) | $21,597
| LTV:CAC Ratio | 70-140x |
| Monthly churn target | <5% |
| Payback period | 1-2 months |

##  COMMISSION TIER STRUCTURE

Agents progress through tiers based on **cumulative qualifying bookings** (lifetime, not annual). This rewards loyalty and consistent performance.

**A qualifying booking is:**
- Fully paid by the client
- Not cancelled or refunded before departure
- Booked through Trip Tailors' platform/RateHawk integration
- Minimum agent comission value of $200 (client price)

| Tier | Annual Comission and planning fee earnings Value | Commission Split (Agent/TT) |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Starter** | $0-$40,000 | 75 / 25 |
| **Rising** | $40,000 | 80 / 20 |
| **Expert** | $60,000 | 85 / 15 |
| **Elite** | $100,000 | 90 / 10 |

*Based on moderate scenario: 60 bookings/year × $600 avg commission

**Why cumulative (not annual):**
- Rewards long-term agents, reducing churn
- Creates a psychological "sunk cost" that discourages switching to competitors
- Simpler for agents to track ("I'm 12 bookings away from Rising")
- Doesn't punish agents for slow months

**Impact on Trip Tailors' Revenue:**
As agents progress, per-agent commission revenue decreases, but this is offset by:
1. Higher-tier agents book more volume (more total revenue despite lower %)
2. Lower churn = lower acquisition costs
3. Successful agents attract other agents through word-of-mouth
4. The subscription + lead marketplace revenue remains constant regardless of tier

## 11. RISK ANALYSIS

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Agent churn (agents leave for competitors) | High | Commission tiers reward loyalty; superior tools create switching costs; lead marketplace creates dependency |
| Low agent acquisition | High | 50M weekly TikTok views provide organic recruitment channel; agents can see the platform works before signing |
| Referral network underperformance | Medium | Diversify beyond TikTok; build SEO/direct website traffic; 3 existing referrers already proven |
| Solo founder risk | Medium | Early hire of agent trainer; advisory board; structured processes reduce bus factor |
| RateHawk dependency | Medium | RateHawk is one of several B2B platforms; can integrate alternatives (Hotelbeds, Bedsonline) |
| Regulatory changes (Dubai/international) | Low | IC model with agent indemnification limits liability; free zone structure provides regulatory clarity |
| Cash flow timing (commissions lag bookings) | Medium | Subscription revenue provides predictable base; 80/20 split ensures immediate commission flow |
| Currency risk (multi-currency operations) | Low | Fixed charges in USD; agent local currency for commissions; hedging via multi-currency accounts |
