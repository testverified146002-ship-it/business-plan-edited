##  COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

| Competitor | Model | Key Difference from Trip Tailors |
|-----------|-------|----------------------------------|
| **InteleTravel** | Traditional host agency | Agents use their credentials; monthly fee $39-$79; no lead marketplace |
| **Fora Travel** | Modern host agency | Invite-only; US-focused; agents use Fora's credentials |
| **Gifted Travel Network** | Luxury host agency | High-end focus; limited tech tools; US-centric |
| **Avoya Travel** | Lead-gen host agency | Provides leads but demands shared credentials; US-only |
| **Travel Planners International** | Traditional consortium | Outdated tech; limited tools; membership-based |

**Trip Tailors' Competitive Advantages:**
1. **Agent Independence** — No credential sharing. Agents keep their own IATA/ATOL. This is a fundamentally different legal and operational model.
2. **Integrated Lead Engine** — Social media referral network with 50M+ weekly views feeding a lead marketplace. No competitor has this.
3. **AI-Powered Tools** — Purpose-built email itinerary builder with AI image extraction, not generic CRM bolt-ons.
4. **Global from Day 1** — Dubai incorporation + international IC model allows agents from any country.
5. **Modern Tech Stack** — React + FastAPI + MongoDB (competitors run on legacy systems).
6. **Cost Efficiency** — $45/month vs $79-$500/month for comparable tool suites.
